## Variables

Best practice is to declare each variable on it's own line like:

```
let gawain;
let niamh;
let alex = null;
let age = 43;
```

## Primative types

In ES6 there are the following primative types

```
let name = 'Gawain'; // string literal
let age = 43; // number literal
let isAllowed = false; // boolean literal
let firstName = undefined; // you would not normally specify a variable to be 'undefined' but that is the default
let lastName = null; // use this to hold a space for something when it's not something else. 
```
